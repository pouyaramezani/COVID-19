# Multimodal Diagnostic of COVID19 
By fusion of x-ray of the chest and the sound of breathing and using the deeplearning.  

Respiratory sounds refer to the specific sounds generated by the movement of air through the respiratory system.  
These may be easily audible or identified through auscultation of the respiratory system through the lung fields with a stethoscope as well as from the spectral chacteristics of lung sounds.These include normal breath sounds and adventitious or "added" sounds such as crackles, wheezes, pleural friction rubs, stertor, and stridor.  
Description and classification of the sounds usually involve auscultation of the inspiratory and expiratory phases of the breath cycle, noting both the pitch (typically described as low, medium or high) and intensity (soft, medium, loud or very loud) of the sounds heard.    

### The correlation between the respiratory sounds and the X-ray of the chest can help the model to find out covid 19 cases precisely
